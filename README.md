# Secret Entrances, Confounding Rooms: Enfer's Trial

This is the game we created for Game Off 2024, theme "Secret". A minimalistic, action-based dungeon crawler.

# Playing

If you just want to play the latest version of the game, it should be available here: https://gx.games/games/i4xwr1/

The link provided is the **only** binary build of the game produced by us. Any other binaries of the game are third-party.

There is no itch page for this game, it was removed after the Game Off finished.

# Building

If you want to modify the game (add/remove rooms, enemies, items), use it as a base for your own project, or just build a native version for your own platform, you should:

1. Read and accept the game's [LICENSE](LICENSE.md).
2. Download a copy of [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en/download). Get the latest stable version, not the LTS release.
3. Clone this repository (or just [download the code](https://github.com/andOlga/game-off-2024/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)).
4. On GameMaker's start page, click "Open", then navigate to the cloned repo and select the `Game Off 2024.yyp` file.
5. Test that the game builds correctly by going to Build -> Run.
6. Optionally, build your native executables by going to Build -> Create Executable.

# Future

This game was created as an experiment and remains as such, I do not intend to personally develop it into a full title. However, in the spirit of experimentation, I am currently working on a [Godot port](../../godot) of this game, which will replace this GameMaker branch as the default landing page once it's complete.
