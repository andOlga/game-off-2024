Create a `PushBlock`:
- Basically a `Wall` on its own, with a unique sprite (something akin to a crate)
- Can collide with other `Wall`s and `PushBlock`s, stopping its movement
- On collision with `PressurePlate`s, toggle them

Create a `Glove`:
- Item pickup
- When used, shoot a `GloveBeam` (similar to `GrappleBeam`):
  - No trail
  - Possibly max distance limit to a couple squares? Dunno if we want players grabbing stuff from all across the room
  - When `GloveBeam` collides with a `PushBlock`, sets that block as "active" and makes it follow player movement
    - "Active" blocks should be recolored to match the color of the glove itself, whatever that ends up being
- When used a second time, lets go of the "active" `PushBlock` if there is one
