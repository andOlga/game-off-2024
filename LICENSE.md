The files found in the Git repository located at https://github.com/andOlga/game-off-2024.git are mostly placed into the public domain, with two things to keep in mind:

- This project bundles parts of [PromptFont](https://shinmera.github.io/promptfont/), which is licensed under the SIL Open Font Licence.
If you do not agree to the terms of the OFL, you must delete the `fonts` folder from any derivative works.
- If you wish to compile the code as-is, you will likely have to rely on [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io) to do so. This will bundle our public-domain code with the GameMaker Runtime, which is subject to their license terms.
  - Therefore, any executable files for this project that are published by us are NOT public domain. You are still free to redistribute these, but you may NOT use these for commercial purposes. If you wish to use this code commerically, you MUST compile it yourself with your own copy of GameMaker (using a commercial license), or modify the code to remove this dependency (e.g. by porting the game logic to a different engine).
